Giuseppe Bergamino is an electronic musician specializing in multimodal artworks and research in human-computer interaction, digital lutherie, generative art, and sound design. He focuses on multimodal interactive installations as his primary expressive medium, aiming to foster a deeper and more intimate connection between users and art through active sensory engagement. His work emphasizes inclusivity and accessibility, striving to break down barriers to artistic and musical expression through adaptive technologies and alternative creative paradigms.

He holds a Master’s degree in Electronic Music & Sound Design ([Conservatory of Music Domenico Cimarosa](http://www.conservatoriocimarosa.org/), Avellino, Italy), where he presented a thesis on Acoustic Augmented Reality in interactive art installations, and a Master’s degree in Technologies for Music Education ([Conservatory of Music Luca Marenzio](https://www.consbs.it/), Brescia, Italy), with a thesis on the development of adaptive digital musical instruments for children with disabilities. In November 2024, he began his PhD studies in the Department of Information Engineering at the [Polytechnic University of Marche](https://www.ingegneria.univpm.it/).
