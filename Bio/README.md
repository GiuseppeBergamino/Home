Giuseppe Bergamino (Avellino, Italy, 1993) is an electronic musician involved in the creation of multimodal artworks and research in the fields of human-computer interaction, digital lutherie, generative digital art and sound design. He has elected multimodal interactive artistic installations as his main expressive medium, believing that the active and sensorial fusion between users and art is able to convey the driving idea of his works with greater and more intimate clarity.
