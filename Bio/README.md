# Bio

Giuseppe Bergamino is an electronic musician specializing in multimodal artworks and research in human-computer interaction, digital lutherie, generative art, and sound design. He focuses on multimodal interactive installations as his primary expressive medium, seeking to deepen the connection between users and art through active sensory engagement. Inclusivity and accessibility are central to his work, with a focus on breaking down barriers to artistic and musical expression via adaptive technologies and alternative creative paradigms.

He holds a Master’s degree in Electronic Music & Sound Design from the [Conservatory of Music Domenico Cimarosa](http://www.conservatoriocimarosa.org/) (Avellino, Italy), where he presented a thesis on Acoustic Augmented Reality in interactive art installations, and a Master’s degree in Technologies for Music Education from the [Conservatory of Music Luca Marenzio](https://www.consbs.it/) (Brescia, Italy), with a thesis on developing adaptive digital musical instruments for children with disabilities. In November 2024, he began his PhD studies in the Department of Information Engineering at the [Polytechnic University of Marche](https://www.ingegneria.univpm.it/).
