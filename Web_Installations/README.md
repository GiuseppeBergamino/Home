## Lucciole

**Lucciole** is a web multimedia installation designed to artistically and historically voice the most significant protest movements of recent decades: the Movement of Movements (No Global), Onda Anomala, and NO TAV. The immense complexities and socio-political diversity of these movements are synthesized in a generative algorithm that controls the random motion of digital fireflies. When these fireflies are close enough to each other, they create instantaneous connections. Depending on the number of connected fireflies and their relative position on the screen, an audio recording derived from interviews, demonstrations, and public actions carried out by the three movements will be played. <br>

The piece is the winner of the [Orizzonti](https://polodel900.it/progetti/orizzonti/) project coordinated by the Piero Gobetti Study Center with Arci Torino, the Antonio Gramsci Institute, Unione Culturale Franco Antonicelli, in collaboration with the Stasis collective and Morsi Editore.

## Devianza Intima

**Devianza Intima** is a metaphor for the feeling of non-conformity to the standards set by a social group and, even more so, by oneself. It conveys the utopian necessity of the constant transformation of the self during the quest for a repressed harmony.

## Salamandra00

**Salamandra00** is a generative cellular ecosystem, personally developed in JavaScript, and digitally residing on a web server. The ecosystem is designed to recreate—through an extensive aggregation of elementary graphic particles—the infinite possible patterns found on the skin of the amphibians known as fire salamanders (_Salamandra salamandra_). The aposematic colors of these amphibians are organized into yellow and black spots: a unique form for each animal, like a fingerprint, intended to deter predators by suggesting high toxicity. <br>
The work thus aims to utopically synthesize all possible combinations of fire salamanders, animals that by tradition and their nature are closely linked to the elements of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air.

## Codice Organico
**Codice Organico** is a generative graphic ecosystem, personally developed in JavaScript, and digitally residing on a web server. The pattern, inspired by a barcode, offers a glimpse into the beauty of algorithmic randomness and digital noise, echoing the unpredictable yet harmonious motifs found in nature.
