<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/vallo_soundscape.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

This work is a **collaborative soundscapes map** developed douring the artistic residency in Padula (SA), Italy. With [Art Center Padula](https://www.artcenterpadula.com/) and [Monaci Digitali](https://www.monacidigitali.it/).

## Lucciole

<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/lucciole.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

**Lucciole** is a web multimedia installation designed to artistically and historically voice the most significant protest movements of recent decades: the Movement of Movements (No Global), Onda Anomala, and NO TAV. The immense complexities and socio-political diversity of these movements are synthesized in a generative algorithm that controls the random motion of digital fireflies. When these fireflies are close enough to each other, they create instantaneous connections. Depending on the number of connected fireflies and their relative position on the screen, an audio recording derived from interviews, demonstrations, and public actions carried out by the three movements will be played. <br>

The piece is the winner of the [Orizzonti](https://polodel900.it/progetti/orizzonti/) project coordinated by the Piero Gobetti Study Center with Arci Torino, the Antonio Gramsci Institute, Unione Culturale Franco Antonicelli, in collaboration with the Stasis collective and Morsi Editore.

## Devianza Intima

<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/devianza_intima.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

**Devianza Intima** is a metaphor for the feeling of non-conformity to the standards set by a social group and, even more so, by oneself. It conveys the utopian necessity of the constant transformation of the self during the quest for a repressed harmony.

## Salamandra00
<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/salamandra00.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

**Salamandra00** is a generative cellular ecosystem, personally developed in JavaScript, and digitally residing on a web server. The ecosystem is designed to recreate—through an extensive aggregation of elementary graphic particles—the infinite possible patterns found on the skin of the amphibians known as fire salamanders (_Salamandra salamandra_). The aposematic colors of these amphibians are organized into yellow and black spots: a unique form for each animal, like a fingerprint, intended to deter predators by suggesting high toxicity. <br>
The work thus aims to utopically synthesize all possible combinations of fire salamanders, animals that by tradition and their nature are closely linked to the elements of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air.

## Codice Organico
<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/codice_organico.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

**Codice Organico** is a generative graphic ecosystem, personally developed in JavaScript, and digitally residing on a web server. The pattern, inspired by a barcode, offers a glimpse into the beauty of algorithmic randomness and digital noise, echoing the unpredictable yet harmonious motifs found in nature.

## Origami
<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/origami.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

**Origami** is an infinite, ever-evolving digital paper organism. Both the graphic and sound components are algorithmically managed, reflecting the image of the ancient art of origami as a metaphor for relentless transformation.

## Monti Picentini Digitali
<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/soundmap.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

Naturalistic outreach web installation containing an interactive sound archive for exploring the sounds of the **Monti Picentini**

## Nuvole
<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/nuvole.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

**Nuvole** is created with the sky and clouds in mind, but with the perspective of being above them. Both the graphic and sound components are designed to follow a generative pattern.

## Pioggia
<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/pioggia.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

Rain is a meteorological event that carries significant auditory and visual potential. **Pioggia** aims to synthesize this concept by presenting a very minimalist depiction of a constantly accumulating thunderstorm, accompanied by glitch and noise sounds.

## Radici
<img src="https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Web_Installations/foto/radici.png" style = "height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none"> 

**Radici** is a study on digital noise and graphic patterns inspired in a hybrid manner by roots and neurons. The idea is to start from chaos and randomness to achieve order and softness. The sound synthesis is based on simple sine waves.
