This work, hosted on [spazioSERRA's website]([https://www.spazioserra.org/](https://www.spazioserra.org/exhibitions/2024-2025-iragenerans/giuseppe-bergamino-dispositivo-di-memoria-a-rumore-residuo), invites the audience to record their anger at maximum intensity through a scream. Each loud noise perceived by the installation becomes a small luminous trace which, combined with others, forms a collective synergy that grows stronger, brighter, and blinding. The memory of collective anger also interacts with the environment: the dots on the screen move according to the intensity of the screams. The scream is resistance; the scream is transformation.

## Lucciole

  alt="Screenshot of Lucciole, showing digital fireflies on a dark background"
  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"
  loading="lazy"
/>

**Lucciole** is a web multimedia installation created to give an artistic and historical voice to the most significant protest movements of recent decades: the Movement of Movements (No Global), Onda Anomala, and NO TAV. The complex socio-political diversity of these movements is condensed into a generative algorithm controlling the random motion of digital “fireflies.” When these fireflies get close enough, they form instantaneous connections, triggering audio recordings from interviews, demonstrations, and public actions by the three movements.

The piece is the winner of the [Orizzonti](https://polodel900.it/progetti/orizzonti/) project, coordinated by the Piero Gobetti Study Center with Arci Torino, the Antonio Gramsci Institute, Unione Culturale Franco Antonicelli, in collaboration with the Stasis collective and Morsi Editore.

  alt="Screenshot of Devianza Intima, abstract shapes symbolizing non-conformity"

**Devianza Intima** serves as a metaphor for the sense of non-conformity to socially imposed standards and, more profoundly, to oneself. It reflects the utopian need for continual self-transformation in the pursuit of a repressed harmony.

## Salamandra00

  alt="Screenshot of Salamandra00, a generative ecosystem resembling fire salamander patterns"

  loading="lazy"
/>

**Salamandra00** is a generative cellular ecosystem, developed in JavaScript and residing on a web server. It aims to recreate—through an extensive aggregation of elementary graphic particles—the infinite possible patterns found on the skin of _Salamandra salamandra_ (fire salamanders). The aposematic colors (yellow and black) deter predators by suggesting toxicity, and each salamander’s pattern is as unique as a fingerprint. The work proposes an utopian synthesis of all possible salamander combinations, linking them to the elements of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air.

**Codice Organico** is a generative graphic ecosystem, developed in JavaScript and residing on a web server. Its barcode-inspired pattern highlights the beauty of algorithmic randomness and digital noise, echoing the unpredictable yet harmonious motifs we find in nature.

  alt="Screenshot of Origami, an infinite evolving digital paper organism"
  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"
  loading="lazy"
/>

**Origami** is an infinite, ever-evolving digital “paper” organism. Both its graphic and sound elements are managed algorithmically, reflecting the ancient art of origami as a metaphor for constant transformation.

  loading="lazy"
/>

**Radici** is a study of digital noise and graphic patterns inspired in a hybrid way by roots and neurons. It begins from chaos and randomness to achieve order and fluidity. The sound synthesis is based on simple sine waves.
