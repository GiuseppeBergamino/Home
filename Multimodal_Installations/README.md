# Multimodal Installations

Giuseppe Bergamino's multimodal art installations blend various sensory experiences to enhance the depth and richness of artistic expression, making the audience an integral part of each unfolding narrative.

## Nostalgia Catodica

**Nostalgia Catodica** explores the question: “Do neural networks also dream of past eras?” The artwork uses modern hand-tracking algorithms to generate sounds and images on old cathode-ray tube televisions.

## Onda
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jS2JrIBUKT0?si=0kTTrdKhwccmwCXh" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

**Onda** represents an oscillatory seismic phenomenon and the imprint it leaves in our memory. Visitors activate the installation by swinging pendulums, which in turn generate sound and light events as they move.

## Horror Vacui

**Horror Vacui** refers to the fear of empty spaces and the tendency to fill them. In this context, the ocean becomes a natural void gradually invaded by anthropogenic noise. For cetaceans—who rely on sound for survival—the intrusion of artificial noise creates a hostile and chaotic environment, causing stress, disorientation, and even death.

The installation invites visitors to experience this sensory invasion, transforming their perception of the void from a spatial concept into an oppressive sonic reality. By interacting with water, the artwork reveals the problem of acoustic pollution to the human ear, evoking empathy and awareness about the need to protect the oceans from this invisible yet devastating form of pollution.

## Flatland – A Geometric Ecosystem
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/VDaHD4LrixQ" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

This digital work is based on **Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions** by Edwin Abbott Abbott (1884), which depicts a two-dimensional universe with inhabitants made of basic geometric shapes, organized into a rigid caste system. A square’s life is turned upside down when it encounters a sphere and glimpses the possibility of higher dimensions.

**Flatland – A Geometric Ecosystem** picks up on this paradox, allowing the user to become a 4D entity exploring Flatland, its inhabitants, and the sphere’s movements. With hand-tracking algorithms and binaural sound spatialization, the experience is immersive and highly interactive, offering a deeper insight into the realm of Flatland and the complexity of its lives.

## Cinque Finestre
![finestre1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GiuseppeBergamino/MontiPicentiniDigitali/gh-pages/docs/assets/finestre1.jpeg)

The artwork features five windows supported by pedestals, each equipped with sensors to monitor its opening. As participants open the windows, they hear binaural soundscapes composed of natural field recordings. Each participant wears headphones with a head-tracking system, ensuring an immersive listening experience.

## Water is Not Sound
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbqZM7buqEc?si=B0APFTB3zpjjoQ0P" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

This artwork consists of a plexiglass tank filled with water and fitted with sensors. Participants’ interactions with the water are translated into sounds that correspond to their gestures. A sound spatialization algorithm allows these sounds to move within a quadraphonic speaker setup.

## Architettura a Gravità di Gocce
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3n_sY6HB830?si=3CtyQChHU7or3GPM" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

This piece creates rhythmic patterns by mechanizing water droplets that fall onto four recycled materials equipped with microphones. Participants can control the speed and quantity of the water drops via an interactive interface with lights and capacitive sensors.

## La Memoria Sogna Forme Liquide
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/qQZ0xAoM1u8" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

Sound and interactive design for an exhibition by artist Noemi Mirata.

## Carillon Fluviale
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEWRg25llOU?si=HYUQknLHEgTpHzNm" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

A generative sound system that produces music based on the flow intensity of a small river.

## RI:USO
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeG66pS7DX0?si=6S-IapyIKm3XQ-em" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

Sound, light, and interactive design for an exhibition by master sculptor Giuseppe Rubicco, in collaboration with Collettivo Agata.

## La Lama e l'Onda
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bQj4xz-669E" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

Sound, light, and motion design. A generative kinetic sculpture created in collaboration with Giuseppe Rubicco and Collettivo Agata.

## Onde Empatiche
![onde_empatiche](https://giuseppebergamino.github.io/Home/Multimodal_Installations/onde_empatiche.png)

Designed to musically and visually connect the less obvious physiological signals of two participants who look into each other’s eyes from a close distance. A sensor system monitors body temperature, heart rate, and skin conductance, transforming these readings into sound and light.

## Vari_azioni_su_AL13
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qbp2NkQKTdk?si=83GFQY_yKuDGvqxM" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

An installation that raises public awareness about creative recycling and the advantages of using aluminum over plastic containers. Participants can play with recycled aluminum cans, each equipped with sensors to trigger rhythmic or melodic patterns depending on the activated “can station.”

## Arterie Cromatiche
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Wvm4ajOasQ?si=OTfBfzHX6dQ4jHTg" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

Created in collaboration with master sculptor Giuseppe Rubicco. The space is filled with lights and glass sculptures of dismembered female bodies. As viewers move, they trigger spatialized sound events across various speakers.

## AR-DRUM
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/BzrOlVYQNpA?si=z0V8dA55nvJkFmFt" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>

A Three.js-based augmented reality experience featuring 16 cubes in a 4×4 grid. Each cube corresponds to an audio file: clicking on a cube plays or pauses the associated sound. The cubes change size in real time based on the volume of the audio they produce. When used with headphones, the app also offers an immersive 3D audio experience.
