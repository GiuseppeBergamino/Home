# Multimodal Installation

Giuseppe Bergamino's multimodal art installations blend various sensory experiences to enhance the depth and richness of the artistic expression, making the audience an integral part of the artwork's unfolding narrative

## Horror Vacui

**Horror Vacui** refers to the fear of empty spaces and the tendency to fill them. In this context, the ocean represents a natural void that has been gradually invaded and filled with anthropogenic noise. For cetaceans, which rely on sounds for survival, this filling of the void with artificial noises creates a hostile and chaotic environment, disrupting their natural behavior and causing stress, disorientation, and death. <br>

The installation invites visitors to experience this sensory invasion, transforming their understanding of the void from a spatial concept to an oppressive and tangible sonic reality. Through interaction with water, the artwork reveals the problem of acoustic pollution to the human ear, evoking empathy and awareness about the need to protect the oceans from this invisible yet devastating form of pollution.

## Flatland - A Geometric Ecosystem
This digital work is based on the book “Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions” by Edwin Abbott Abbott, first published in 1884. The novella depicts a two-dimensional universe where inhabitants are made out of basic geometric shapes and are organized into an extremely rigid caste system: a figure's social power increases with the number of its sides. The narrator’s life—a square—is completely taken aback when he first encounters a sphere. With this incredible and new 3D shape, the square starts a journey in lands with many different dimensions: Pointland (0D), Lineland (1D), Flatland (2D) and Spaceland (3D). After that, the Square’s mind is open to the idea of endless multi-dimensional worlds, in particular he tries to convince the Sphere of the existence of the fourth dimension. Ironically enough, the Sphere blames the Square for this blasphemous idea.
**Flatland - A Geometric Ecosystem** moves from this final paradox and gives the user the ability to become a 4D entity that can freely explore Flatland, its population, and the movements of the Sphere. Thanks to hand-tracking algorithms and binaural sound spatialization, the user’s experience is granted to be immersive and highly interactive; becoming a 4D entity can enhance the possibility of comprehending the fantastic realm of Flatland and the complexity of the lives of its inhabitants.
