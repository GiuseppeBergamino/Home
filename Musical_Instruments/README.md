# Musical Instruments

Giuseppe Bergamino is engaged in the research and development of new musical instruments and human-machine interfaces for sound control and production. The design of his instruments is strongly based on multimodality, the concept of ubiquitous computing, and inclusivity for musicians with disabilities.

**Acchiappasuono** is a wearable digital device that allows the user to interact with and manipulate the binaural sound they are listening to through headphones. The system is equipped with sensors that monitor the movement of the hand, wrist, and fingers, translating the data into acoustic parameters. A pattern of micro-motors provides haptic feedback of the manipulation.
